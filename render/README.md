# Usage

```yaml
- name: Render Quarto Project
  uses: step-security/quarto-actions/render@v2
  with:
    to: html # If set, it will be equivalent to `quarto render --to html`
    path: source-folder # By default, the current working dir is used i.e `quarto render .`
```

`path:` can be a path to a subdirectory containing the quarto project to be rendered or a path to a single .qmd file

## Rendering with a Quarto profile

You can render with a specific profile by setting the `QUARTO_PROFILE` environment variable. For example, to render with the `preview` profile (i.e. you have a `_quarto-preview.yml` file in your project), you can do:

```yaml
- name: Render Quarto Project
  uses: step-security/quarto-actions/render@v2
  env:
    QUARTO_PROFILE: preview
  with:
    to: html
```
